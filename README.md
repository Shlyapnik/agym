# Arcanoid-v2.0
I have wish to improve my previos project(Arcanoid). I was impressive by work of DeepMind, they make game Atari and create AI to play instead human. I will add some agym.agym.items and try to move it to android. But,first of all, need research models for bot.
If you try to load this game, you must have: python v3.0+, PyGame(package of python), NumPy(package of python).
To load game just load file "arcanoid.py".
